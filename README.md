# Reset-Printers

This script removes (including drivers) and reinstalls all network printers on your computer which should fix any outdated drivers or other printing related issues.

Naturally, Administrator-level access is required.

If something goes wrong, the list of originally installed printers can be found in C:\Temp\printers.txt
